# Contents
- data/: This directory holds the datasets used for analysis. Make sure to place your data files in this folder.

- queries/: This directory contains SQL queries written for various analytical tasks. Each query file focuses on a specific aspect of EDA, such as data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and visualization.

- notebooks/: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step instructions and examples for performing EDA with SQL. The notebooks are well-documented, making it easy to understand and replicate the analysis.

- results/: This directory stores the output files generated during the EDA process. It includes tables, charts, and visualizations that provide valuable insights into the dataset.
    
# How to Use
- Install the required dependencies, such as SQL database management system and Jupyter Notebook, if not already installed.

- Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open the desired Jupyter notebook.

- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to perform EDA tasks using SQL queries.

- Feel free to modify the queries or create new ones to suit your specific analysis requirements.

- Store your datasets in the data/ directory and update the file paths in the queries accordingly.

- Execute the queries and observe the results in the results/ directory. Make use of the visualizations and tables generated to gain insights from the data.
